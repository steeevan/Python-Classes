# Lesson Plan: Basic Operations and Expressions in Python
# ===============================================

# **Objective:** Teach arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and logical expressions in Python.

# ===============================================
# 1. Introduction to Expressions
# ===============================================

# Expressions are combinations of values and operators that can be evaluated to produce results. They are fundamental in programming and allow us to perform calculations and make decisions.

# ===============================================
# 2. Arithmetic Operations
# ===============================================

# Python supports various arithmetic operations:

# - Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
# - Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
# - Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
# - Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
# - Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
# - Exponentiation (**): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
# - Floor Division (//): Returns the integer part of the division.

# Example:
result = 10 + 5  # Addition
result = 15 - 7  # Subtraction
result = 3 * 4   # Multiplication
result = 20 / 5  # Division
result = 17 % 4  # Modulus
result = 2 ** 3  # Exponentiation
result = 21 // 5 # Floor Division

# ===============================================
# 3. Comparison Operators
# ===============================================

# Comparison operators allow us to compare values and produce Boolean results (True or False):

# - Equal (==): Checks if two values are equal.
# - Not Equal (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
# - Greater Than (>): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
# - Less Than (<): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
# - Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
# - Less Than or Equal To (<=): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

# Example:
result = 10 == 5   # Equal
result = 10 != 5   # Not Equal
result = 15 > 7    # Greater Than
result = 3 < 4     # Less Than
result = 20 >= 5   # Greater Than or Equal To
result = 17 <= 4   # Less Than or Equal To

# ===============================================
# 4. Logical Expressions
# ===============================================

# Logical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions:

# - Logical AND (and): True if both conditions are true.
# - Logical OR (or): True if at least one condition is true.
# - Logical NOT (not): Inverts the result of a condition.

# Example:
condition1 = True
condition2 = False

result = condition1 and condition2  # Logical AND
result = condition1 or condition2   # Logical OR
result = not condition1             # Logical NOT

# ===============================================
# 5. Exercises
# ===============================================

# Exercise 1: Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units using arithmetic operations.

# Exercise 2: Compare your age with a friend's age and print whether you are older or younger.

# Exercise 3: Write a program that checks if a given number is even (use the modulus operator).

# Exercise 4: Create a logical expression that checks if you have both ice cream and chocolate, and print whether you can make a delicious dessert.

# ===============================================
# 6. Conclusion
# ===============================================

# In this lesson, you've learned about expressions in Python, including arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and logical expressions. These concepts are fundamental for performing calculations and making decisions in programming.

# Continue practicing with different expressions to become a proficient Python programmer. Enjoy your coding journey!
