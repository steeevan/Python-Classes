### **Section 1: Basic Loop Exercises**

#### **Exercise 1: Multiplication Table**
Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a number entered by the user.

#### **Exercise 2: Factorial Finder**
Write a program that calculates and prints the factorial of a number provided by the user.

#### **Exercise 3: Guess the Number Game**
Write a program where the user has to guess a randomly chosen secret number between 1 and 20. Give hints ("Too high!" or "Too low!") until the user guesses correctly.

### **Section 2: Real-World Applications**

#### **Application 1: Sum of Numbers**
Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and a user-defined number.

#### **Application 2: Prime Number Detector**
Write a program to find and print all prime numbers in a range entered by the user (e.g., 1 to 100).

#### **Application 3: Countdown Timer**
Create a countdown timer that starts from a user-defined number and ends with "Liftoff!"

#### **Application 4: Even and Odd Separator**
Write a program that takes a list of numbers entered by the user and separates them into two lists: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers. Display the two lists.

### **Section 3: Advanced Challenges**

#### **Challenge 1: Maximum Finder**
Write a program to find the maximum number in a list of integers entered by the user.

#### **Challenge 2: String Reversal**
Write a program that takes a string input and reverses it using a loop.

#### **Challenge 3: Fibonacci Generator**
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a number of terms entered by the user.

#### **Challenge 4: Pattern Printing**
Write a program that prints the following pattern for a user-specified number of rows:
```
*
**
***
