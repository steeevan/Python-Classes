Homework 2

Problem 1: Random Walk Variations
- Modify the random walk code to make the turtle move forward by a random distance between 10 and 50 units each time. 
- Adjust the angle so that the turtle turns by a random angle between 0 and 180 degrees.


Problem 2: Random Color Changing
- Enhance the random walk code by changing the pen color randomly for each movement.
- Use a list of colors and pick one randomly for each segment of the walk.


Problem 3: Spirograph with Variable Radii
- Create a new function that draws a spirograph with variable radii. 
  Instead of a fixed radius, make the radius of each circle a random number between 50 and 150 units. 
  The turtle should still rotate by the specified angle.


Problem 4: Multiple Spirographs
- Write a program that creates multiple spirographs with different sizes and colors.
- Use a loop to draw three spirographs, each with a different size (e.g., 5, 10, and 15 degrees) and a different starting position.


Problem 5: Random Spirograph with Random Colors and Radii
- Create a function that draws a spirograph where both the radius of the circles and the pen color are chosen randomly.
  The function should draw a spirograph with a random radius between 50 and 150 units and use random colors for each circle.

  
Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
