Homework 10: Enhancing the Basic Login System

Problem 1: Add a Clear Button
- Create a new button labeled "Clear" that clears the username and password fields.
- Write a function called clear_fields that sets both the username_entry and password_entry to empty strings.
- Link the "Clear" button to the clear_fields function.

  
Problem 2: Username and Password Validation
- Add a basic validation function that checks if the username and password fields are not empty before updating the result label.
- If either field is empty, display a message in the result_label saying "Please enter both username and password."

  
Problem 3: Display a Welcome Message
- Modify the update_result_on_screen function to display a welcome message in the format: "Welcome, [username]!" after successful validation.
- Change the text in the result_label accordingly.

  
Problem 4: Change the Password Entry Field
- Add a checkbox labeled "Show Password" that allows the user to toggle the visibility of the password.
- When checked, the password should be visible (use show=''), and when unchecked, it should be hidden (use show='*').


Problem 5: Customize the GUI
- Change the background color of the main window to a light color (e.g., light blue).
- Style the labels with a different font size or weight to make them stand out.

  
Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
