Homework 11: Enhancing the Dice Rolling App

Problem 1: Add a Reset Button
- Create a button labeled "Reset" that resets the rolls list and clears the rolls table.
- Write a function called reset_game that clears the rolls list, resets the guess_counter, and updates the relevant labels and table.

  
Problem 2: Improve User Input Handling
- Add a label above the entry widget that instructs users to "Enter a number between 1 and 6:".
- Ensure that the entry field is cleared after each roll, regardless of whether the guess was correct.

  
Problem 3: Add a History Feature
- Create a new label to display the total number of rolls after each dice roll (e.g., "Total Rolls: X").
- Update this label each time a roll is made.

  
Problem 4: Style the GUI
- Change the background color of the main window to a light color (e.g., light green).
- Style the labels and buttons with different fonts and colors to make them more visually appealing.

  
Problem 5: Include Sound Effects
- Add a sound effect that plays when the dice is rolled (you can use a simple placeholder function that prints a message, e.g., "Playing sound...").
- Use the pygame library or similar to play a sound file if you have access to one.


Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
