Homework: Enhancing Your Tkinter To-Do List Application

Objective: Practice your skills with Tkinter by working on a To-Do List application. 
This homework will focus on adding functionality and improving the existing code based on what you've learned.

Part I. Add a Clear All Tasks Button
The current application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed, 
  but does not provide a way to clear all tasks at once. 
Implement a feature to clear all tasks from the list.
1. Add a button labeled "Clear All Tasks" to the application window.
2. Implement the clear_all_tasks() function to remove all tasks from the tasks and completed_status lists.
3. Ensure that after clearing all tasks, the task_listbox and status labels are updated accordingly.

Hints:
  - You can use the task_listbox.delete(0, tk.END) method to clear the listbox.
  - Remember to call update_listbox() after clearing the tasks to refresh the displayed information.

Part II. Handle Empty Task Entry in add_task Function
Currently, the add_task() function shows a warning if the task entry is empty. 
  Improve this function to also handle cases where the task description might only contain whitespace.
4. Modify the add_task() function to check if the task entry contains only whitespace (e.g., spaces or tabs).
5. Ensure that the application shows a warning message if the task entry is empty or only contains whitespace.

Hints:
  - You can use the str.strip() method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the task entry.

Part III. Confirm Task Removal with a Dialog
Enhance the remove_task() function to confirm with the user before removing a selected task. 
  This will help prevent accidental deletions.
7. Modify the remove_task() function to show a confirmation dialog before actually removing the selected task.
8. Implement the confirmation dialog using messagebox.askyesno(), which should ask the user if they are sure they want to remove the selected task.
9. Only remove the task if the user confirms the action.

Hints:
  - Use messagebox.askyesno() to display a confirmation dialog with "Yes" and "No" options.
