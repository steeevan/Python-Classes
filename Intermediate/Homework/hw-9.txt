Homework 9: Enhancing the Simple Drawing App

Problem 1: Add a Brush Size Reset Button
- Create a new button labeled "Reset Size" in the options frame.
- Write a function called reset_brush_size that resets the brush size back to the default (5).
- Link the button to the reset_brush_size function.


Problem 2: Add a Background Color Option
- Create a button labeled "Change Background" that allows users to choose a background color for the canvas.
- Use colorchooser to let the user select a color and update the canvas background color accordingly.


Problem 3: Save the Drawing
- Add a button labeled "Save Drawing" that saves the current canvas drawing as an image 
file (use a simple placeholder function to print a message, e.g., "Drawing saved!").
- You can implement this as a simple function for now, and you can explore image saving methods later.


Problem 4: Create a Line Drawing Mode
- Add a button labeled "Line Mode" that switches the drawing mode from ovals to lines.
- Write the logic to handle drawing lines instead of ovals when this mode is activated. 
  Make sure to use the mouse events to capture start and end points for the lines.


Problem 5: Drawing Instructions
- Above the canvas, add a label that provides simple instructions for using the 
app (e.g., "Draw by clicking and dragging the mouse. Change color and size using the buttons and slider.").
- Style the label to make it visually appealing (e.g., bold text or a different color).

  
Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
