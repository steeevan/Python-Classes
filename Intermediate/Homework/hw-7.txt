Homework: Enhancing Your Tkinter To-Do List Application

Problem 1: Add a Task Counter
Instructions:
- Add a label to the GUI that shows the total number of tasks in the listbox.
- Update this label each time a task is added or removed.
Hints:
- Create a label with a descriptive text, such as "Total Tasks: 0".
- Update this label in the add_task() and remove_task() functions.


Problem 2: Change Task Status
Instructions:
- Add a new button labeled "Toggle Task Status" in the GUI.
- When this button is clicked, if a task is selected in the listbox, toggle its status between completed and uncompleted.
- Ensure the listbox and status labels are updated to reflect the change.
Hints:
- Use the mark_task_completed() function as a reference to modify the status.
- Check if the task is already completed, then set it to uncompleted if it is, and vice versa.


Problem 3: Task Entry Validation
Instructions:
- Modify the add_task() function to ensure that the task entry is not just whitespace.
- If the entry is only spaces or empty, display a warning message to the user.
Hints:
- Use the strip() method on the task entry to check for whitespace.
- Display the warning using messagebox.showwarning() if the task is invalid.

  
Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
