Homework 5

Problem 1: Add a New Shape
- Modify the existing code to add a new shape: Octagon.
- Update the shape_var options and calculate_area function to handle this new shape.
- Ensure that the drawing function (animate_octagon) is implemented to animate the octagon similarly to the other shapes.

Problem 2: Add a Custom Color Option:
- Modify the code to allow users to select a custom color for the shape instead of automatically choosing one based on the area.
- Add a new text entry or color picker to the GUI where users can input a color name or hex code.

Problem 3: Comment your code
- Comment each line of your code explaining what it means/does.
