Homework 16: Expanding the Turtle Graphics Project

Problem 1: Add New Shapes
- Extend the shape_type list by adding at least three new shapes (e.g., octagon, heart, or rectangle).
- Implement the drawing logic for each new shape in the draw_shape function.

  
Problem 2: Dynamic Shape Sizes
- Modify the random size generation so that each shape has a minimum size:
  - Circle: minimum radius of 20
  - Square: minimum side length of 20
  - Triangle: minimum side length of 20
  - New shapes should also have appropriate minimum sizes.

  
Problem 3: User Input for Shape Count
- Before starting the drawing, prompt the user to enter how many shapes they want to draw (using input()).
- Use this value to determine the number of shapes drawn in the loop instead of the hard-coded 30.

  
Problem 4: Shape Outlines
- Modify the draw_shape function to add a black outline to each shape.
  - Set the pen color to black before drawing each shape.
  - Ensure that the outline does not fill the shape.

  
Problem 5: Color Palette Customization
- Allow the user to specify a list of colors at the start of the program.
- Prompt them to enter colors separated by commas, then split and store these in the colors list.


Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
