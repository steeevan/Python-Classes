Homework 12: Enhancing the Turtle Race Game

Problem 1: Add a Reset Button
- Create a button labeled "Reset Race" that allows the user to reset the race and create new turtles.
- Write a function called reset_race that clears the turtle graphics and prompts the user to enter the number of turtles again.

  
Problem 2: Add a Timer
- Implement a timer that tracks how long the race takes. Display the elapsed time in the Turtle graphics window when the race finishes.
- Use Python's time module to record the start and end time of the race.

  
Problem 3: User Input for Turtle Names
- Modify the get_racers function to allow users to input names for each turtle. Store these names in a list and display the name of the winning turtle at the end of the race.
- If the user does not enter a name, default to "Turtle X" (where X is the turtle's number).

  
Problem 4: Change Turtle Speed
- Add a slider in the Tkinter GUI to adjust the speed of the turtles (from 1 to 10, where 10 is the fastest).
- Use this speed setting in the move_turtle function to control how far the turtles move each time.


Problem 5: Improve the User Interface
- Style the Tkinter GUI with a different background color and font for the buttons.
- Add labels to indicate the turtle names, their current positions, or the status of the race (e.g., "Race in Progress...").


Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
