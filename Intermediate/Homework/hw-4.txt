Homework 4

Problem 1: Draw a Hexagon and Fill It with Color
- Write a function to draw a hexagon with each side measuring 80 units.
- Fill the hexagon with a color of your choice.


Problem 2: Create a Mandala Design
- Write a function to draw a mandala-like design consisting of concentric circles.
- Start with a circle of radius 50 units and draw 10 circles, each circleâ€™s radius increasing by 10 units.
- Arrange the circles so they are centered around the same point.


Problem 3: Animate a Spinning Triangle
- Write a program that animates a triangle spinning around its center.
- The triangle should have sides of 100 units and should spin 360 degrees in 30 steps, with a slight delay between each step.


Problem 4: Draw a Nested Square Pattern
- Write a function to draw a pattern of nested squares.
- Start with a square of side 50 units and draw 10 squares, each square being 10 units larger in side length than the previous one.
- Ensure that all squares are centered around the same point.



Problem 5: Draw a Complex Fractal Pattern:
- Use recursion to draw a fractal pattern with a set of smaller triangles recursively.
- Start with an equilateral triangle and recursively draw smaller triangles inside it.
- Set the depth of recursion to 3 for a detailed pattern.

  
Additional Tips:
- Utilize online resources, Python documentation, and course materials to reinforce your understanding.
- Collaborate with classmates to discuss concepts and problem-solving.
- Seek assistance from your instructor or classmates if you encounter difficulties.
